			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of Whittier Lawn Care is to not only inform people in the area about the local business, but 
                have a way for people to sign up for it. This website is also to help people desire to sign up for the services.

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Home Owners in Saratoga Springs and Eagle Mountain</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>There will be a modular JavaScript file that has an array with all of the lawn care services. Then there will be a function to generate a the HTML for each service and a function to render each of them. 
                There then will be JavaScript that whenever you click on one of the services, it displays a hidden form and automatically fills out some of the form according to the service you picked.
                This will include a button to close the form if you change your mind. There will also be javascript to display a message when you sign up for the service.
            </p>
