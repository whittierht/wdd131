                <p>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider 
                    on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the 
                    commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in 
                    all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they 
                    hold out faithful to the end they are received into 
                    heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a 
                    state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember 
                    hat these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</p>

                <p>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been 
                    from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, 
                    unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, 
                    and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint 
                    through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh 
                    as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of 
                    love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth 
                    fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</p>
